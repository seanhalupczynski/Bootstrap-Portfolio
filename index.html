                        <p> I was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania. I attend Penn State University. 
                            In 2010, I graduated with a Management Infomration Stystems & Supply Chain Management degree. 
                            After graduation, I begain may working career at United Way of Erie County.
                            I was the Database and Systems Coordinator at United Way of Erie County. 
                            My responsibilities were to uphold the data integrety of out donor database and maintain our 
                            IT infrastucture. I spent just over four years until being hired by Liberty Mutual.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            Liberty Mutual hired me as a Business Systems Analyst in their Financial Systems department. 
                            There, I worked on building out analytic databases, backend infrastructure, and frontend user 
                            interface projects. In November of 2016, I transitioned into the Claims IT department and placed on the 
                            Regulatory Reporting team. The team's focus is on our Personal Insurance Loss Reporting database.
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            Outside of work, I enjoy staying active. You can find me at the gym, 
                            playing basketball, playing softball, and mostly on the golf course. 
                            I also enjoy keeping my mind sharp by doing puzzles, such as crosswords and sudoku. 
                            I also enjoy going to triva nights at local bars and restaurants. 
                            I have been told by my friends that I don't know everything about certain things, 
                            but I know certain things about everything.
