                        <p> I was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania. I attend Penn State University. In 2010, I graduated with a Management Infomration Stystems & Supply Chain Management degree. After graduation, I begain may working career at United Way of Erie County.

                            I was the Database and Systems Coordinator at United Way of Erie County. My responsibilities were to uphold the data integrety of out donor database and maintain our IT infrastucture. I spent just over four years until being hired by Liberty Mutual.
                            
                            Liberty Mutual hired me as a Business Systems Analyst in their Financial Systems department. There, I worked on building out analytic databases, backend infrastructure, and frontend user interface projects. In November of 2016, I transitioned into the Claims IT department and placed on the Regulatory Reporting team. The team's focus is on our Personal Insurance Loss Reporting database.
                            
                            Outside of work, I enjoy staying active. You can find me at the gym, playing basketball, playing softball, and mostly on the golf course. I also enjoy keeping my mind sharp by doing puzzles, such as crosswords and sudoku. I also enjoy going to triva nights at local bars and restaurants. I have been told by my friends that I don't know everything about certain things, but I know certain things about everything.
